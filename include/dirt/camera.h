/**
    This class represents a virtual pinhole camera.
   
    The camera is responsible for generating primary rays. It is positioned
    using a Transform and points along the -z axis of the local coordinate
    system. It has an image plane positioned a z = -dist with size
    (width, height).
   
    We currently only support pinhole perspective cameras. This class could
    be made into a virtual base class to support other types of cameras
    (e.g. an orthographic camera, or omni-directional camera).
